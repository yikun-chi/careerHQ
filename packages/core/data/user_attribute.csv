4,Work Interests & Values,,,
4.B,Interests and Work Values,1.B,,Preferences for work environments and outcomes
4.B.1,General Occupational Interests,1.B.1,,"Preferences for work environments. Occupational Interest Profiles (OIPs) are compatible with Holland's (1997) model of personality types and work environments. Six interest categories are used to describe the work environment of occupations: Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional. An OIP consists of six numerical scores indicating how descriptive and characteristic each work environment (or interest area) is for an O*NET-SOC occupation. In addition, a high-point profile has been assigned indicating which interests are most characteristic of an O*NET-SOC occupation. A high-point profile consists of one to three interest codes, depending on how many interest categories meet a minimum degree of descriptiveness for the O*NET-SOC occupation."
4.B.1.a,Realistic,1.B.1.a,,"Work involves designing, building, or repairing of equipment, materials, or structures, engaging in physical activity, or working outdoors. Realistic occupations are often associated with engineering, mechanics and electronics, construction, woodworking, transportation, machine operation, agriculture, animal services, physical or manual labor, athletics, or protective services."
4.B.1.b,Investigative,1.B.1.b,,"Work involves studying and researching non-living objects, living organisms, disease or other forms of impairment, or human behavior. Investigative occupations are often associated with physical, life, medical, or social sciences, and can be found in the fields of humanities, mathematics/statistics, information technology, or health care service."
4.B.1.c,Artistic,1.B.1.c,,"Work involves creating original visual artwork, performances, written works, food, or music for a variety of media, or applying artistic principles to the design of various objects and materials. Artistic occupations are often associated with visual arts, applied arts and design, performing arts, music, creative writing, media, or culinary art."
4.B.1.d,Social,1.B.1.d,,"Work involves helping, teaching, advising, assisting, or providing service to others. Social occupations are often associated with social, health care, personal service, teaching/education, or religious activities."
4.B.1.e,Enterprising,1.B.1.e,,"Work involves managing, negotiating, marketing, or selling, typically in a business setting, or leading or advising people in political and legal situations. Enterprising occupations are often associated with business initiatives, sales, marketing/advertising, finance, management/administration, professional advising, public speaking, politics, or law."
4.B.1.f,Conventional,1.B.1.f,,"Work involves following procedures and regulations to organize information or data, typically in a business setting. Conventional occupations are often associated with office work, accounting, mathematics/statistics, information technology, finance, or human resources."
4.B.2,Work Values,1.B.2,,"Occupational Reinforcer Patterns (ORPs) indicate which work values and needs are likely to be reinforced or satisfied by a particular O*NET-SOC occupation. The use of work values to describe occupations is based on the Theory of Work Adjustment (TWA) developed during the Work Adjustment Project at the University of Minnesota under Research Grants from the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (Dawis, R.V., England, G.W., & Lofquist, L.H., 1964; Dawis, R.V., & Lofquist, L.H., 1984). This theory proposes that job satisfaction is directly related to the degree to which a person's values and corresponding needs are satisfied by his or her work environment. The TWA identifies six work values each with a corresponding set of needs."
4.B.2.a,Achievement,1.B.2.a,,"Occupations that satisfy this work value are results oriented and allow employees to use their strongest abilities, giving them a feeling of accomplishment. Corresponding needs are Ability Utilization and Achievement."
4.B.2.b,Working Conditions,1.B.2.b,,"Occupations that satisfy this work value offer job security and good working conditions. Corresponding needs are Activity, Compensation, Independence, Security, Variety and Working Conditions."
4.B.2.c,Recognition,1.B.2.c,,"Occupations that satisfy this work value offer advancement, potential for leadership, and are often considered prestigious. Corresponding needs are Advancement, Authority, Recognition and Social Status."
4.B.2.d,Relationships,1.B.2.d,,"Occupations that satisfy this work value allow employees to provide service to others and work with co-workers in a friendly non-competitive environment. Corresponding needs are Co-workers, Moral Values and Social Service."
4.B.2.e,Support,1.B.2.e,,"Occupations that satisfy this work value offer supportive management that stands behind employees. Corresponding needs are Company Policies, Supervision: Human Relations and Supervision: Technical."
4.B.2.f,Independence,1.B.2.f,,"Occupations that satisfy this work value allow employees to work on their own and make decisions. Corresponding needs are Creativity, Responsibility and Autonomy."
