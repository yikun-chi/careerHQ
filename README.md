## Problem Definition

Modern job platforms fail job seekers. They overwhelm users with poorly organized listings or encourage indiscriminate mass applications, leading to confusion, wasted effort, and low success rates. While career coaches provide objective guidance, structured frameworks, and accountability that enable confident, informed career decisions, access to high-quality coaching is limited and inherently non-scalable. No single coach can possess deep expertise across the full spectrum of roles and industries. As a result, most people navigate critical career decisions without personalized direction, relying on trial-and-error instead of strategy.


## App Description
CareerHQ is an AI-powered career coaching and navigation platform that creates a deeply structured, dynamic profile of each user across hundreds of career-relevant attributes. By ingesting resumes, ongoing conversations, and user-provided notes, CareerHQ develops a comprehensive understanding of an individual’s skills, experiences, preferences, goals, and constraints. This foundation enables personalized guidance, role navigation, and actionable career strategies that scale expert-level coaching beyond the limitations of human advisors.
